# odin-landing-page

Creating a landing page for odin project... well, project.

The page will have 4 sections, will need lots of divs.
Main div will be set up with 4 divs in a column.

Not sure on a few things, will learn a bit more, and come back later to finish.
Also, I need to figure out some actual content to put in, to make it more interesting to make.
For now, I can get everything done, except for what I want to do with the "sign-up" link.
Do I want to make it a button? Or maybe just a div? Then I have to figure out the sizing for it.

Everything else is fairly easy to do, fairly simple flex boxes within main divs.
